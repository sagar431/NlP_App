# GUI NLP APP IN Tkinter

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that is built using the Tkinter GUI framework in Python. The application allows users to register and log in to the system. Once logged in, the user can perform several NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and emotion prediction.

The sentiment analysis feature of the application enables users to analyze the sentiment of a given text, which could be positive, negative, or neutral. The named entity recognition feature identifies and extracts specific entities such as names, locations, and organizations from a given text.

The emotion prediction feature of the application predicts the emotion of a given text, which could be happy, sad, angry, or neutral. The application uses a pre-trained model to perform these tasks.

Overall, this project demonstrates the capabilities of NLP and how it can be used to build powerful applications. The use of Tkinter GUI framework makes the application user-friendly and easy to navigate. The application could be useful for individuals or organizations that need to analyze large volumes of text data.
